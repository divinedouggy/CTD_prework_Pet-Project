Pet Project is a little pet project of mine; a simple little app where you can lose yourself in a random shuffle of dog breeds, with pictures and breed information. Click the **New Dogs** button to be dealt a new hand of dogs.

### Bonus: Cats!
There's also a cat section where you are bombarded with cat pictures. No information here, just a visual feast of cats; 10 at a time in fact. A **New Cats** button is also included here, delivering 10 new cats with just a click. Feeding your cat picture addiction has never been easier.
